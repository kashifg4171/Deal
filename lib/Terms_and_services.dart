Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation Section or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and DEAL agree (1) to waive your and DEAL’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, the DEAL Service or the Materials, resolved in a court, and (2) to waive your and DEAL’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and DEAL agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).\n\nB. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. You and DEAL agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the DEAL Service or the Materials is personal to you and DEAL and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and DEAL agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and DEAL agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.\n\nC. Federal Arbitration Act. You and DEAL agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nD. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. You and DEAL agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to DEAL shall be sent by certified mail or courier to DEAL Providers. Your notice must include (1) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Account, and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (2) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (3) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent to the email address you used to register for your Account, and will include (a) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and DEAL cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or DEAL may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section , commence an arbitration proceeding, or to the extent specifically provided for in the terms, file a claim in court.\n\nE. Process. Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and DEAL agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or DEAL within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and DEAL will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and DEAL agree that (1) any arbitration will occur in the country you are in, (2) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (3) that the state or federal courts of the country you live in, respectively, sitting in the country you live in have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the country of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.\n\nF. Authority of the Arbitrator. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\n\nG. Rules of JAMS. The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (1) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (2) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.\n\nH. Severability. If any term, clause or provision of this Section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of these Sections will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in these terms are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.\n\nI. Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of these Sections by writing to: DEAL PROVIDERS. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt-out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the terms of service.',
